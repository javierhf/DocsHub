## New order

**New order** creates new orders with new configurations while _the rules of the catalogue are automatically applied_.

We will complete _the sections of the configuration_ from _left to right_.

If the vehicle doesn't have different available versions, we can configure a _base model_ .

**VALIDATE AN ORDER**

_Validate_ will check the configuration against the system of the importer and display the results of the check. In case of error, we can _Edit_ again our order.  

![](Images/es-ES_idea.png) _Validate order_ will be active if our dealer has the permissions to communicate with the manufacturer.
