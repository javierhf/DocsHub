# ORGANIZER  


The **Organizer** is a panel divided in two well-differentiated areas, _header_ and _working area_, and there you can find: the _mechanics_ and the mechanic's _availability_, the _blocks of jobs_ and _jobs (active or paused)_, all day-grouped.

## Working Area   

The rest of the screen is the **Organizing Area** where we can check _the mechanics_ in our workshop, their _availability_ and the _block of jobs_ and _jobs_ assigned to them for each vehicle.    

 The block of jobs give us information about:

 - ![Appointment](images/en-EN_organizer_icon_receptionplanneddate.png)![Appointment](images/en-EN_organizer_icon_deliveryplanneddate.png) _Reception planned date_ and _Delivering planned date_.  
 -  ![Jobs](images/en-EN_organizer_icon_wrench.png) Iniciated jobs and jobs already iniciated (currently unattended).  
 - Planned time for each job and block of jobs.  
 - Order: ![Order](images/en-EN_Organizer_Orders.png)  
 - Appointment:  ![Appointment](images/en-EN_Organizer_Appointment.png)    
 - Repetitive damage:  ![Repetitive damage](images/en-EN_Organizer_RepetitiveDamage.png)  
  
   
Here we can check the information about:  

 - ![Appointment](images/en-EN_organizer_icon_receptionplanneddate.png) ![Cita](images/es-ES_organizer_icon_deliveryplanneddate.png) _Scheduled date for reception_  and _Delivery date for the vehicle.    
- ![Jobs](images/es-ES_organizer_icon_wrenchs.png) Already initiated jobs and jobs where we have been working.  
- Scheduled date for each job and block of jobs.    
 

  
![](Images/en-EN_idea.png) The **Organizer** groups the non-scheduled damages automatically together in the souce order.  

In addition, we can drag and drop jobs and blocks of jobs within a mechanic's column and between different mechanics in order to:

 -  Assign a job or block of jobs from one mechanic to another.  
 -  Prioritize the jobs already assigned to a mechanic.  
 -  Assign all jobs linked to an order (drag&drop).  
 - Split jobs and modify the planned time from ![More options](images/en-EN_organizer_icons_moreoptions.png).

![Split jobs](images/en-EN_remember.png) The Workshop Organizer will not split a job **if the target mechanic has no availability**.
