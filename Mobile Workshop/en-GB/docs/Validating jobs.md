## Validating jobs  
![](Images/es-ES_mobileworkshop_jobslist.png)

**Validating jobs** with the customer closes the reception process by getting the signature of our customer in order to comply the estimated jobs.  
  
![](Images/es-ES_Mobileworkshop_ValidateCustomerJobs.png) 

The summary and compliance form is accesible by tapping on ![List of jobs](images/es-ES_mobileworkshop_jobslist.png)     
  
Once _the customer has signed_ we can:  

> - **Send an email** to our customer with the summary of planned jobs and his/her signature.  
> - **End the recepction** of the vehicle.    
  
![](Images/es-ES_remember.png) Once signed the order will be saved independently if we will send it or not by email.  
  
  
### List of jobs 
  
The **list of jobs** ca be checked on the left side of the validation form.

If we add _jobs of campaigns_ already applied, **Workshop Mobile** will notify us.  

![Recuerde](images/es-ES_remember.png) Jobs added during the reception will not appear until we save them.
