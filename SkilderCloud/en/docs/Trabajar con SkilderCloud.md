At any moment, we can know the total number of orders ** Ongoing_, _Espera_ and _Blocked_. In addition, for each phase we are informed about the ** total orders ** at that stage.
  
The ** commands ** show us the mechanic assigning, the _order_ number, the _matrÃ­cula_ and the _model_ of the vehicle besides the _Color_.
