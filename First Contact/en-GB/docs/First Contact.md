**First Contact** eases the process of selling a vehicle ot our customer in our dealer, both stock vehicles and orders, and configurations. At the end of the process we will end an email with the offer for our customer. 
  
To do so, we navigate the different pages that explains the selling process: _Select_ or _Configure_ a vehicle, _Gather_ the customer information, _Show_ multimedia material and _Valuate_ the vehicle before sending the offer.
