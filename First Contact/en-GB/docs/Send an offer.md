We can create an offer directl  from of the page **Vehicle_, both from the details of a vehicle or from a configuration. Furthermore, we ca make an offer containing  up to 3 vehicles.

We can create an offer from the following pages:

 -   **Vehicle**, tapping on _Create Offer_ in the commands bar (direct offer) or _Sent to Offer_ (multiple offer).  
 -   **Offer**, after adding up to 3 vehicles to the offer's page, we tap on _Create Offer_ (_commands bar_). 
 


For both cases, we will have to fill the _offer's form_ with all the data about our customer, offer and select if we want to **send an email** with the offer's details to our customer.

The **Offer** page will be activated after adding the first vehicle. Removing vehicles from our offer will be always available.  

**Exceptions** 

It will not be possible to add a vehicle to the **Offer** page when:  

 - The vehicle is blocked or reserved.  
 - The vehicle has been previously added to the same offer.   

  

   
![Recuerde](images/es-ES_remember.png) Remember to check the option _Send offer to customer_ so the offer changes its state to _delivered to customer_ and then appears in your salesman agenda.
