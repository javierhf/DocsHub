### Updating campaigns  

 **Updating cammpaigns** won't be affected by the feedback of our customer, so the _Customer profile_ will keep a certain campaignr until one of these situations occur:

 - The campaign is already applied.  
 - The customer already has an appointment to apply the campaign.
