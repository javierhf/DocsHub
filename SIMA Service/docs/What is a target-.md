# Target  

   

**Target** is the _coupled_ information or _opportunity_ represented by the information of a vehicle (VIN) and its owner, and processed by brands (VW, VW Sales, AUDI and Skoda), representing every step of the vehicle's life cycle:    

> **Revisions:**  
> - First revisions.
> - Next revisions. 
   
>  **Other services:**   
> - Spark plug maintenance. 
> - Timing belt maintenance.   
> - Brake fluid.   
> - Expiration of warranty.    
  



  

**What is an _opportunity_?**  

**SIMA Serive** takes the coupled information of _Vehicle/Customer_ as an _opportunity_ when it matches at least these minimum requirements:  

 - The customer and related customers haven't expressed their will about not being contacted by any means.
 - Owner and holder are not a Dealer nor a Fleet.  
 - The customer or the related customers has a contact telephone number.


_Opportunities_ are shown according to their _estimated date of service_ as follows:   
   

>**1.** From today on (ascending ordered).  
>**2.** Opportunities that have passed its _expiration date_ (descending ordered).  
 

The following parameters are also taken into account:
  
> - **Average time** for customers to call informing about the first maintenance (average market estimation: 26000km, and not 30000km).  
> - **Last visit kilometers notation** noted in the workshop, discarding notations made during the first month after delivering.  
> - **Homogeneous group** of the oil filter that identifies if the first maintenance service was or wasn't already made. If this value was left empty, it will be not possible to detect the status of the first maintenance.    
  
  
## Target of maintenances  
  

**Target of maintenances** includes the targets of **First revision** and **Next revisions** and shows all the _opportunities_ matching these additional requirements:  
 
> - Sold vehicles for the last 30 months.  
> - Vehicles near to be of 18 months, or kilometers to note  26000 km.  
> - Vehicles with pending services or without a date to do it.    
    

![Next maintenances](images/en-EN_opportunity_nextmaintenances.png)  

    

**Next revisions** works with the _opportunities_ that have been previosly contacted so that **SIMA Service** recalculates the following information:    

> - Previous maintenances date (last revision).  
> - Last kilometers register.     


Depending on the feedback we have noted from our customer, **SIMA Service** updates the information of the revisions:

![Revisions info](images/en-EN_opportunity_maintenancesbox.png)  


> - Planned (date will apper after mouse over).  
> - Not done. 
> - **<span style="color:red; font-family:; font-size:;">Expired date</span>**.
> - **<span style="color:green; font-family:; font-size:;">Next revisions date</span>**.     


![Recuerde](images/en-EN_remember.png) Maintenance plan for the brands here named is every 2 years or 30000kms.

**TARGET OF OTHER SERVICES** 
  
## Spark plugs change 

This target registers the homogeneous groups of NEZ y NZZ and visualizes opportunities that:  
  
> **1.** Matches the general specifications defined for targets.  
> **2. **Includes those vehicles with a _Estimated date_ of timing belt change ofr **1 months**.   

The _Estimated date_ is calculated according to the following parameters:  

> - Delivery date of the vehicle.  
> - Estimation for the kilometers made; i.e. if the vehicle is making 60.000kms soon after looking the registers or 4 years old.   
> - Engine code.
 
There is an alternative configuration of 90000kms or 6 years old for the following engine codes: aac,aaj.

## Timing belt change   

This target includes **First change of timing belt** y **Next changes of timing belt** and it registers the homogeneous groups of MFA, MFC y MFS.   

Opportunities are shown according to:  

> - The _estimated date_ that is calculated based on the delivery date.
> - The kilometers marker register, when close to reach 120.000kms.  
 
   
The **Next change of timing belt** shows those opportunities previously processed (or with an appointment) and whose next appointment is **in 1 month**.

![Remeber](images/en-EN_remember.png) Timing belts have to be change in 8 years time after the of delivery or at 120.000kms.  
   


## Break fluid change    

This target includes the **First change of break fluid** and **Next changes of break fluid** and registers the homogeneous group of CCA.   

The opportunities are shown based on:  

> - The _Estimated date_ that is calculated from the delivery date.
> - The kilometers market registration, when close to 120.000kms.
> - The first break fluid change is suggested for 3 years after the delivery date.
 

Moreover, break fluid will show opportunities **1 month** before those _3-years time_ are reached giving us the date of the last change of break fluid.

> - Without an _acceptance feedback_ (they are shown first).
